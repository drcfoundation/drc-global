        The assets for s3 DR Vaults are routed through Uniswap v2 liquidity and
        during the period of Uniswap v2 and v3 migration, it’s uncertain whether
        all of the projects will remain on Uniswap v2 or move to v3. If they
        move, then the s3 DR Vaults may experience liquidity issues.

      <Text component="div" textSize={14} margin={{ bottom: grid(2) }}>
        Further, there are unclear regulatory guidelines for DeFi investment
        protocols at present and this may present a challenge for s3 DR Vault's
        compliance.

        Please note that the upgraded DR Vault s1 and s2 will remain active and
        available to DR users as it contains highly liquid assets and does not
        constitute an investment proposal. DRC Vault will also remain available
        to DR users and allows secure storage of DRC tokens and incentives for
        DRC holders.
